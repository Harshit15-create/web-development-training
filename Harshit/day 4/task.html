            <hr>
            <p>
                A brave, beautiful, and brilliant young woman 
                is imprisoned by a beast in his castle. Despite her
                 fears, she learns to see beyond the beast's hideous exterior 
                 and realize the gentle heart of the true prince within him.
            the promise to support her, inspire her and above all, give the utmost 
            love-for better or worse, in sickness and health, for richer or poorer.
             she is her only one and only, today tomorrow and forever.</p>
